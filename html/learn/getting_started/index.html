  <h1>Rock music</h1>
  <p>
    <strong>Rock music</strong> is a broad genre of popular music that originated as <strong>"rock and roll"</strong>
    in the United States in the late 1940s and early 1950s, developing into a range of different styles in the mid-1960s
    and later, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom.[3] It has its roots in 1940s and 1950s
    rock and roll, a style that drew directly from the blues and rhythm and blues genres of African-American music
    and from country music. Rock music also drew strongly from a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk,
    and incorporated influences from jazz, classical, and other musical styles. For instrumentation, rock has centered
    on the electric guitar, usually as part of a rock group with electric bass, drums, and one or more singers.
    Usually, rock is song-based music with a 4
    4 time signature using a verseâ€“chorus form, but the genre has become extremely diverse. Like pop music, lyrics
    often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political.
